*GIF Editor mockup.*

Basic capability to specify start and end frames of an existing GIF. Sampled frames are to be shown to visualize the GIF timeline. A user should be able to bring up this window via the “GIF Saved” notification, or a right-click on any GIF file. 
Being able to trim the start/end points should be sufficient for an initial iteration.

Wox is still unstable, and plugin API changes frequently. When it comes stable, we will provide executable file download.


Create plugin
=========

Currently, Wox support using C# and Python to write your plugins. Please refer to [Create-plugin](https://github.com/qianlifeng/Wox/wiki/Create-plugins) page for more infomation.

Share plugin
=========

Share your plugin through <a href="http://wox.scottqian.com/">WoxPlugins</a>. After you upload your plugin, other uses can download or search your plugin through `plugin` command (this is a plugin for plugin management, which is one of the default plugins inside Wox).

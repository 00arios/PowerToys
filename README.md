Download
=========

WinAlfred is still unstable, and workflow API changes frequently. When it comes stable, we will provide executable file download.


Create workflow
=========

Currently, WinAlfred support using C# and Python to write your workflows. Please refer to [Create-workflows](https://github.com/qianlifeng/WinAlfred/wiki/Create-workflows) page for more infomation.

Share workflow
=========

Share your workflows through <a href="http://winalfred.scottqian.com/">WinAlfredWorkflows</a>. After you upload your workflow, other uses can download or search your workflow through `wf` command (this is a workflow for workflow management , which is one of the default workflows inside winalfred).

# PowerToys Out Of Box Experience Proposal and Code

## Overview
A team of Microsoft Garage interns have created a proposal for the out-of-box experience after the first time install of the PowerToys app, and a proposal for the UI experience of updates.

## 1. Welcome Screen

#### Code:

#### Considerations:

## 2. FancyZones Adaptive Sizing Layout Change

#### Rationale: The Settings update in v18 will introduce the "About Feature" side tab. When minimized, the "About Feature" section goes to the bottom of Settings - harder to find when there are lots of settings. We propose moving the "About Feature" section to the top of the Settings when minimized.

<img align="left" src="./images/FancyZones_smaller_window_new.png" /> Smaller window UI 

#### Code:

```
